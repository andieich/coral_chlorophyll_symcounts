    "text": "Measurement\n\nOverview\nThe chlorophyll concentration (\\(µg~mL^{-1}\\)) is calculated based on the formulas given in (Jeffrey & Humphrey, 1975):\n\\[\n\\text{Chlorophyll}~a = 11.43 \\frac{A_{663} - A_{750}}{PL}  – 0.64\\frac{A_{630} - A_{750}}{PL}\n\\]\n, where \\(A_{663}\\), \\(A_{630}\\), and \\(A_{750}\\) is the absorption at 663, 630, and 750 nm, and \\(PL\\) the path length of the cuvette (1 cm).\nThe photometer can read whole plates (96 samples). However, since acetone is used to extract the chlorophyll, a quartz cuvette has to be used instead of plates made of plastic. The software of the photometer still visualizes the measurements of this cuvette as a plate which can be confusing.\nThe photometer will automatically measure the absorption at 663, 630, and 750 nm and does the blank-correction automatically. Each measurement is done twice and blanks are measured at the beginning and after every 10 samples, resulting in the following plate outlay:\n\nBLK corresponds to blank measurements and SPLXX to samples.\nFollow these steps to enter the metadata (which sample is at which position, file names, etc).\n\n\nMaterials\n\nVortexter\nCentrifuge with rotor 12154\nIce\nAcetone\nKimwipes\n1000 µL pipette & tips\nBioTek Epoch2 microplate reader\nQuartz cuvette (dark and shattered)\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nAfter the incubation (note down incubation time), vortex samples for 15 s and centrifuge samples using rotor 12154 for 5 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. Keep samples on ice and in darkness. Transport samples carefully to not damage the pellet.\nTurn on BioTek photometer and connect to Dell via USB.\nDouble-click on 2024_04_20_chlorophyll+carotinoides_andi.prt to start software (backup stored here).\nClick on Create experiment and read now:\n\nAt first, the photometer takes a background measurement without any cuvette inserted. Follow the instructions in the pop-up and click OK.\n\nStart measuring the blank. Clean quartz cuvette with acetone and Kimwipes, add 500 µL acetone, and insert cuvette into photometer. Click OK in pop-up window.\n\nRepeat blank measurement. Click on Oui in pop-up window.\n\nMeasure first sample. Remove cuvette from photometer, clean with acetone and Kimwipes and add 500 µL sample extract. Click on Oui in pop-up window (as for second blank measurement).\nRepeat measurement (click Oui).\nRemove cuvette from photometer, clean with acetone and Kimwipes and measure next sample.\nRepeat as described before for 10 samples (i.e. 20 measurements). Then, measure blank as described before (2x) and continue to measure samples. Take care not to damage the pellet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you do a mistake in the sequence of measurements, correct it accordingly in the table (see Problems)\n\n\n\nWhen all samples are measured or after 43 samples, click on Non in pop-up window.\nSave experiment in your folder.
