### Material

-   [ ] Counting chamber (Thoma) with glass cover
-   [ ] Ethanol 96%
-   [ ] Kimwipes
-   [ ] Microscope with objective lens 20X
-   [ ] 50 µL pipette and tips **CHECK!**

### Method

1.  Clean haemocytometer with distilled water and Kimwipes.

2.  Vortex sample for 15 s.

3.  Add 10 µL sample solution into each of the 2 chamber in the haemocytometer.

4.  Count 10 of the

5.  

6.   If more than **XXX**, dilute sample, e.g. 200 mL sample (`V_zoox` in metadata sheet) with 800 µL SST (`V_sw`).

7.  Count Symbiodiniaceae in both chambers. Repeat above steps in total three times per samples (6 count replicates per sample).

8.  Between each count, clean haemocytometer with ethanol and Kimwipes.
